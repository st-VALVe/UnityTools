# Unity Tools

I have developed various tools for the Unity editor throughout my gamedev career in different companies. These tools have been a constant part of my projects, and I have continually transferred them from one project to another.
Recognizing their potential value to others, I've decided to make them publicly available. Some of them are really simple but can make your development life a bit easier. 
Therefore, I created this repository to showcase these tools, and I plan to periodically update it with some tools from time to time. I hope you find them as useful as I have.

### Align Scene View to Game

Occasionally, there's a need to quickly align the scene view in the editor to match the current game view. This can typically be done using Unity's standard function "Align View to Selected" after selecting the game camera.
However, this method aligns only the transform and does not match the field of view, which can be a critical difference.
To address this, I've created a script that utilizes hotkeys, allowing for fast and precise alignment that ensures a 100% match.
